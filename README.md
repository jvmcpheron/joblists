### What I learned

I learned about JSON files, which store data using JavaScript object syntax like this:

  {
    "id": 1,
    "company": "Photosnap",
    "logo": "./images/photosnap.svg",
    "new": true,
    "featured": true,
    "position": "Senior Frontend Developer",
    "role": "Frontend",
    "level": "Senior",
    "postedAt": "1d ago",
    "contract": "Full Time",
    "location": "USA Only",
    "languages": ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"],
    "tools": []
  }

I also learned how to access data from the JSON file and populate the page with it.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com) - As always, this documentation is so useful in helping me quickly code out some basic frontend designs.
